# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA Practice Repository**! This repository is dedicated to improving my problem-solving skills by practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in multiple programming languages: **Java**, **Python**, and **JavaScript**.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms**.
- Solve a variety of problems across difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming challenges.
- Track my daily progress and stay consistent with practice.

## ðŸš€ Programming Languages

- **Java**: Focus on OOPs and backend development.
- **Python**: Quick prototyping and scripting.
- **JavaScript**: For web-related problem-solving and logic building.
